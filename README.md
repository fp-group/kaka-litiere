# FPGroup: Kaka-Litter project
A collaboration between [@Pariente](https://github.com/nfilzi) (front-end) && [@nfilzi](https://github.com/Pariente) (back-end)

## Purpose
Build a minimalist e-commerce platform for FPGroup to sell the byproduct of its stones extraction activity.
No payment on the platform.
The orders are sent to a Google Spreadsheet, that acts as the staff's back-office (for orders and customers)
